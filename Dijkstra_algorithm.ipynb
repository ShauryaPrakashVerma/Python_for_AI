        "\n",
        "- Dijkstra's algorithm is a famous algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "      - **Start at a source node:** You pick a starting point in your graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - **Keep track of distances:** The algorithm maintains a set of visited nodes and an estimate of the shortest distance from the source node to every other node. Initially, the distance to the source is 0, and the distance to all other nodes is considered infinite.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - **Greedily explore:** At each step, the algorithm selects the unvisited node with the smallest estimated distance from the source.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - **Update distances:** For the selected node, it examines all its neighbors. If the distance to a neighbor through the current node is shorter than the current estimated distance to that neighbor, it updates the neighbor's distance.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - **Mark as visited:** Once all neighbors of the selected node have been examined, the node is marked as visited.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - **Repeat:** Steps 3-5 are repeated until all nodes have been visited or the shortest path to the target node is found."
