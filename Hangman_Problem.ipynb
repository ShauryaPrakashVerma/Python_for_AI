        "## **Hangman Problem Statement**\n",
        "\n",
        "Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where a player tries to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Objective:** The player's goal is to correctly guess all the letters in the hidden word before the \"hangman\" figure is completed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Gameplay:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Word Selection:** A word is chosen (either by the computer or another player) and hidden from the player.\n",
        "2.  **Initialization:** The game displays a series of underscores or blanks representing the letters of the hidden word.\n",
        "3.  **Guessing:** The player guesses one letter at a time.\n",
        "4.  **Correct Guess:** If the guessed letter is in the hidden word, all instances of that letter are revealed in their correct positions.\n",
        "5.  **Incorrect Guess:** If the guessed letter is not in the hidden word, a part of the hangman figure is drawn (e.g., head, body, arms, legs). Each incorrect guess brings the player closer to losing.\n",
        "6.  **Winning:** The player wins if they guess all the letters in the word before the hangman figure is completed.\n",
        "7.  **Losing:** The player loses if the hangman figure is completed before they guess the word.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Constraints/Variations:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Number of Attempts:** The game typically has a set number of incorrect guesses allowed (e.g., 6 or 7), corresponding to the number of parts in the hangman figure.\n",
        "*   **Letter Reuse:** Players cannot guess the same incorrect letter multiple times and be penalized for each guess.\n",
        "*   **Input Validation:** The game should handle invalid input (e.g., numbers, symbols, multiple letters).\n",
        "*   **Word List:** The game can use a predefined list of words, or words can be generated dynamically.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Implementation Considerations:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   How to store and represent the hidden word?\n",
        "*   How to keep track of guessed letters (both correct and incorrect)?\n",
        "*   How to display the current state of the word with revealed letters?\n",
        "*   How to manage the number of remaining attempts?\n",
        "*   How to draw the hangman figure?\n",
        "\n",
        "This problem involves elements of string manipulation, conditional logic, and potentially data structures like lists or sets to manage guessed letters."
